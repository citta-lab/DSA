# BIG O
The goal of this doccumentation is to capture `Time` and `Space` complexity for all the data structure which we use in solving algorithm problems and techniques. Intention is to give a gilmps not no means to list all the problem complexity.

## Arrays :

## Stack / Queues :

## HashMap / Set :

## Nested for/While loop :

## LinkedList: 

## Binary Search Tree:

## Binary Tree: 

## Graphs:
### Dijkstra Algorithm for Shortest Path:
| Time | Space | DS |
| --- | --- |--- |
| O(N^2) | O(N) | When used with Array |
| O(N logN) | O(N) | When used with min Heap |
## Sliding Window:

## Toposort:

## Recursion:
