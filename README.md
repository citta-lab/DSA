# Data Structure and Algorithms

These curated problems are from my leet code, algo expert, freecodecamp practice problem. I might not be shooting for the best solution here but more of the appraoch i enjoyed and worth
making a note as i forget the nitty gritty details as days goes on.

## Binary Tree

Here is the [binay tree problems](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/) from leetcode. The repo here is seperated into binary-tree, binary-search-tree, nth-tree, graphs and linkedList-to-binary-tree to seperate the topics and focus on the common patterns.
