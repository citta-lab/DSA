Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/     
Answer: https://github.com/citta-lab/DSA/blob/main/strings/680.valid-palindrome-II.js   
Hint: use count < 1 in while condition, create isPalindrome(s,left,right) func

### 2. 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/   
Answer: https://github.com/citta-lab/DSA/blob/main/strings/005.longest-palindromic-substring.js   
Hint: start left,right at 0 but move then outward. use for loop and then two
whileloops one for even, one for odd
